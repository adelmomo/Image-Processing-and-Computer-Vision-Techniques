# Edge Detection

This project implements one of the most fundamental concepts in Computer Vision: Edge Detection. The primary goal is to demonstrate various edge detection methods and their implementation on a sample image. This project serves as both an educational resource and a practical example for those interested in understanding the basics of image processing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone "https://github.com/adelmomo/Image Processing and Computer Vision Techniques/Edge Detection"
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Input and Output

Here is an example of the input image and the resulting edge-detected output:

### Input Image:
![Input Image](./sample.jpg)

### Edge Detected Output:
![Output Image](./output.jpg)

## Usage

To run the edge detection algorithm on a sample image, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py -i ./sample.jpg -o output.jpg
